# CMPM 121 D2 Project

Student: Andrew Degan
Completion Date: 10/27/2025
Course: CMPM 121
Assignment: D2: Sticker Sketchpad

This demo assignment uses a canvas as a sketchpad that users are able to draw on.
The user is able to:
-Draw on the canvas using either single points (click and release) or lines (click and drag)
-Undo and Redo lines that they have drawn
-Clear the canvas
-Change their brush size and color
-Place stickers onto the canvas
-Change the size of their stickers
-Add custom stickers using any string of their choosing
-Export the drawing to the user's canvas, either with or without a background

This demo focused on the student adding more and more features to an application while keeping their code in check. Students had to constantly refactor code and do their best to comply with their own established rules so that code is not only efficient, but readable for the student and any others who read their program.
